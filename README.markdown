Rails Documentation Builder
===========================

It always frustrates me when I’m working with an older version of Rails that the only documentation available at [api.rubyonrails.org](http://api.rubyonrails.org/) is for the latest version of Rails. Sure, you could go hunting and picking through `~/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.X.X-pXXX@XXX/gems/activeXXX-X.X.X/lib` and find the documentation in the source, but that would make me a hacker and I would prefer to remain a humble bard and not some anarchist neckbearded malcontent. So, in the grand tradition of Byron and Keates, I created this script to use [SDoc](https://github.com/voloko/sdoc) to generate documentation for every version of Rails.

The documentation generated by this script is available at [rails.documentation.codyrobbins.com](http://rails.documentation.codyrobbins.com/).

Invoking
--------

To build all the documentation, run

```
zsh build.zsh
```

It takes a long time.

Options
-------

A few environment variables control some build options. To set them when invoking the script, just do

```
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS=12345 GZIP=true zsh build.zsh
```

### Google Analytics

Set `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS` to a Google Analytics tracking ID to have the Google Analytics tracking code added to every page in the documentation.

### Gzip

Set `GZIP` to compress all HTML, CSS, and Javascript files and then remove their `.gz` extension. This is useful if you’re going to serve the files with a `Content-Encoding: gzip` header.

Dependencies
------------

* [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)
* [RVM](https://rvm.io/)

Colophon
--------
